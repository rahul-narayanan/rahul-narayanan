To route API calls from your frontend Angular app through a proxy to your NestJS backend server using an NGINX server, you can follow these steps:

Configure NGINX:

First, you need to configure NGINX to act as a reverse proxy for your frontend and backend servers. Create an NGINX configuration file, let's say nginx.conf, and add the following configuration:

nginx
Copy code
server {
    listen 80;

    # Frontend app
    location / {
        root /path/to/frontend/dist; # Path to your Angular app's build output
        index index.html;
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
    }

    # API calls
    location /api/ {
        proxy_pass http://backend-server:backend-port; # Replace with your actual backend server details
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
Replace /path/to/frontend/dist with the actual path to your Angular app's build output directory. Replace backend-server and backend-port with the appropriate hostname and port where your NestJS backend is running.

Start NGINX:

Make sure NGINX is installed on your server and start it using the following command:

bash
Copy code
sudo nginx -c /path/to/nginx.conf
Update Frontend API Calls:

Modify your frontend Angular app's API calls to use the proxy route. For example, if you had an API call like this:

typescript
Copy code
const apiUrl = 'http://backend-server:backend-port/api/endpoint';
Update it to use the relative path /api/endpoint instead:

typescript
Copy code
const apiUrl = '/api/endpoint';
With this change, the frontend app will make requests to the /api/ route, which NGINX will forward to your NestJS backend server.

CORS Configuration (if needed):

Since your frontend app and backend server might be running on different domains or ports, you might need to handle Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) to allow communication between them. In your NestJS backend, you can use the @nestjs/axios package or other middleware to set up CORS properly. For example:

typescript
Copy code
import { NestFactory } from '@nestjs/core';
import { AppModule } from './app.module';
import { createProxyMiddleware } from '@nestjs/axios';

async function bootstrap() {
    const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule);
    
    // Enable CORS
    app.enableCors();

    await app.listen(3000);
}
bootstrap();
Make sure to adjust the CORS configuration according to your requirements.

By following these steps, you'll have set up NGINX as a reverse proxy to route API calls from your frontend Angular app to your NestJS backend server. This setup allows you to handle the proxying and CORS configuration effectively while serving both the frontend and backend from the same server.

Great. How to do it using variables as i have different evvironment for deployment
ChatGPT
If you have different environments for deployment and you need to use variables to configure the NGINX proxy settings, you can achieve this by using environment-specific configuration files. Here's how you can do it:

Create Environment-Specific Configuration Files:

For each environment (e.g., development, production, staging), create a separate NGINX configuration file that contains environment-specific settings. For example, create files like nginx.dev.conf, nginx.prod.conf, etc., and store them in a directory.

Use Environment Variables:

Set environment variables on your deployment environment that correspond to the necessary values in your NGINX configuration. For example, you can set environment variables for backend server host and port, as well as any other configuration values.

Dynamically Load Configuration:

Modify your NGINX configuration file to load environment-specific configuration based on the environment variables. Here's a simplified example using shell scripting:

nginx
Copy code
server {
    listen 80;

    # Frontend app
    location / {
        root /path/to/frontend/dist;
        index index.html;
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
    }

    # API calls
    location /api/ {
        proxy_pass http://$BACKEND_SERVER:$BACKEND_PORT;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
In this example, $BACKEND_SERVER and $BACKEND_PORT are environment variables that you set according to the deployment environment.

Deploy and Use Scripts:

When deploying your NGINX configuration, use deployment scripts or tools to copy the appropriate environment-specific configuration file to the NGINX configuration directory and restart NGINX. These scripts can set the required environment variables based on the deployment environment.

By structuring your deployment process this way, you can easily manage different configurations for different environments using environment variables and corresponding configuration files. This approach ensures flexibility and consistency while allowing you to adapt to various deployment scenarios without hardcoding values into your NGINX configuration.

How to load the env file based on environment
ChatGPT
To load environment-specific configuration files in NGINX based on the environment, you can use the following approach:

Create Environment-Specific Configuration Files:

For each environment (e.g., development, production, staging), create separate NGINX configuration files that contain environment-specific settings. Store these files in a directory named after the environment (e.g., dev, prod, staging).

Use Environment Variables:

Set an environment variable that indicates the current environment. For example, you can set an ENVIRONMENT variable with values like dev, prod, or staging.

Modify NGINX Configuration to Include Environment-Specific File:

In your main NGINX configuration file (nginx.conf), use the include directive to dynamically include the environment-specific configuration file based on the value of the ENVIRONMENT environment variable.

Here's an example of how you can structure this in your main nginx.conf:

nginx
Copy code
server {
    # Common server settings here...

    # Include environment-specific configuration
    include /path/to/nginx/conf/$ENVIRONMENT/nginx.conf;
}
In this example, /path/to/nginx/conf/ is the directory where you store environment-specific configuration files, and $ENVIRONMENT is the environment variable you set.

Deployment Scripts:

When deploying your NGINX configuration, ensure that the ENVIRONMENT environment variable is set correctly. You can use deployment scripts or tools to manage this. For example, when deploying to a specific environment, you would set the ENVIRONMENT variable to the appropriate value before starting NGINX.

By following this approach, you can easily manage environment-specific NGINX configuration files without modifying the main nginx.conf file. This allows you to keep your configuration organized and makes it easy to switch between different environments during deployment.
