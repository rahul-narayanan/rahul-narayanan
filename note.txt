/**
 * CachingInterceptor
 *
 * This NestJS interceptor handles caching of API responses to improve performance
 * by storing and retrieving data from a cache store, such as Redis.
 *
 * It intercepts incoming requests and checks if the corresponding response data
 * is already cached. If cached data exists, it returns the cached data; otherwise,
 * it proceeds with the request, caches the response data, and returns it.
 *
 * @remarks
 * Make sure to configure the caching service and adjust the cache key generation
 * according to your application's requirements.
 *
 * @example
 * // Apply this interceptor globally or on specific routes/controllers.
 * @UseInterceptors(CachingInterceptor)
